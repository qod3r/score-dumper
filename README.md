## Behold!
### My ~~horrendously bad~~ first rust project.

* Listens to a gosumemory websocket stream, edits the data a little and dumps scores (even unsubmitted ones) to a local mongo database 

* Intented for use in ml/data science/local dashboard thingies

* Any feedback/PRs are greatly appreciated

### TODO
- [ ] better readme
- [x] rosu-pp values instead of outdaded gosu ones
- [ ] support for [tosu](https://github.com/KotRikD/tosu)
